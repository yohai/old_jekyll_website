abstract: "Problems of flexible mechanical metamaterials, and highly deformable porous solids in general, are rich and complex due to nonlinear mechanics and nontrivial geometrical effects. While numeric approaches are successful, analytic tools and conceptual frameworks are largely lacking. Using an analogy with electrostatics, and building on recent developments in a nonlinear geometric formulation of elasticity, we develop a formalism that maps the elastic problem into that of nonlinear interaction of elastic charges. This approach offers an intuitive conceptual framework, qualitatively explaining the linear response, the onset of mechanical instability and aspects of the post-instability state. Apart from intuition, the formalism also quantitatively reproduces full numeric simulations of several prototypical structures. Possible applications of the tools developed in this work for the study of ordered and disordered porous mechanical metamaterials are discussed."
