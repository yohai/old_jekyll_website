abstract: "Inhomogeneous polymers play an important role in various cellular processes, both in nature and in biotechnological applications. At finite temperatures, inhomogeneous polymers exhibit non-trivial thermal fluctuations. In a broader context, these are relatively simple examples for fluctuations in spatially inhomogeneous systems, which are less understood compared to their homogeneous counterparts. We develop a statistical theory of torsional, extensional and bending Gaussian fluctuations of inhomogeneous polymers, where the inhomogeneity is an inclusion of variable size and mechanical properties, using both continuum and discrete approaches. First, we analytically calculate the complete eigenvalue and eigenmode spectrum of the inhomogeneous polymer within a continuum field theory. In particular, we show that the wavenumber inside and outside of the inclusion is nearly linear in the eigenvalue index, with a nontrivial coefficient. Second, we solve the corresponding discrete problem, and highlight fundamental differences between the continuum and discrete spectra. In particular, we demonstrate that above a certain wavenumber the discrete spectrum changes qualitatively and discrete evanescent eigenmodes, that do not have continuum counterparts, emerge. The statistical thermodynamic implications of these differences are then explored by calculating fluctuation-induced forces associated with free-energy variations with either the inclusion properties (e.g.~inhomogeneity formed by adsorbing molecules) or with an external geometric constraint. The former, which is the fluctuation-induced contribution to the adsorbing molecules binding force, is shown to be affected by short wavelengths and thus cannot be calculated using the continuum approach. The latter, on the other hand, is shown to be dominated by long wavelength shape fluctuations and hence is properly described by the continuum theory."
