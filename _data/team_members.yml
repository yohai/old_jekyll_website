    I mostly hang around the other people and make sure they're not too productive.

    Théo is working on understanding the dynamics of deep neural 
    network training using tools from statistical physics (Langevin dynamics, etc.)

    Amit is looking at the random dynamics of interacting colloidal particles
    to see what we can learn about their interactions from their kinematics. 
    This work is in collaboration with [Roy Beck's lab](https://www.becklab.sites.tau.ac.il/).

   Shachaf is looking at a geometrical description of soft mechanical meta-materials. 
   He's using  [our recently developed formalism](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920237117), 
   to study disordered metamaterials and understand emergent phenomena such as the collapse
   dynamics, localization properties and more.

   Nir is looking at extensions of our [recent paper about calculating entropy 
   with machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2017042117). He's trying
   to apply the method to disordered systems with non stationary dynamics (e.g. 
   the Kovacs effect) and look at entropy generation.
