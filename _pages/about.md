We study physics of complex systems using tools from statistical physics, non linear mechanics, machine learning and computational physics. We are a research group at the [School of physics and astronomy](https://physics.tau.ac.il) in [Tel Aviv University](https://www.tau.ac.il).  The group is also a member of Tel-Aviv University's [BioSoft Center](https://www.biosoft.sites.tau.ac.il/) and [Data Science center](https://datascience.tau.ac.il/).
