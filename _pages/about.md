We are a new research group at the [School of physics and astronomy](https://physics.tau.ac.il) in [Tel Aviv University](https://www.tau.ac.il). We study physics of complex systems using tools from statistical physics, non linear mechanics, machine learning and computational physics. 

The site is under renovation. In the meanwhile, you can check out who's [on the team](./group) or our [publications page](./publications) to see what we're up to.
